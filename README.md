# Game Overview â€“ Flappy Bird Clone
 Flappy Bird Clone is a simple yet addictive endless runner game where the player controls a bird trying to fly through an infinite series of pipes without crashing into them. The bird ascends with each tap (or click), and gravity constantly pulls it downward. The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible to achieve the highest score.
